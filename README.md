# AnimalFinder

The Animal Finder web page is a project developed by three
Kent State Students Kayla Carter, Sarah Reen, and Andreas Schaler as
Introductory Data Base Class colabrative project.

Purpose of the Project:

The web page, Animal Finder, is designed to store and share data about animals up for adoption and provide users searching with an
opportunity to submit applications to adopt an animal. By increasing the publics awarness about the avaiabilty of animal adoption, we can continue to help decrease the rate of euthanization, and increase
adoption rate.
